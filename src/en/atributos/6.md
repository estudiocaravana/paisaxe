The names of the main rivers of the Ribeira Sacra come from Palaeo-European roots meaning water. Such is the essence of this humid land, also steeped in the immaterial spirit of water, which survives in the spells of the _mouras_ that guard its springs; in the fiery treasures, which will always end up submerged in the river; in the love of its people for the _xacias_, which dwell in the deep wells of the rivers; in those arms offered to the Sil, in that "religion of the springs"; in the divine waters that Marti√±o de Dumio, founder of the first monastic communities of this Ribeira, pursued.

The river grape harvest, the numerous festivals and traditions, the sacralisation of springs and the survival of a multitude of unique hydronyms.
