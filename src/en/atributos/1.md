The union of the rivers Miño and Sil and hundreds of watercourses form a territory of high canyons and deep river valleys, where the water flows between steep slopes.

The strip of land that overlooks the steep slopes from the high plateau is known as the _bocarribeira_. The _bocarribeiras_ of the rivers Miño and Sil in Ribeira Sacra are home to numerous villages overlooking the valley floor.

Despite the apparent naturalness and isolation, it is a river space that has been intensely and extensively intervened, where every available metre of land has been adapted to the needs of human life. Nature, the human race, its beliefs, yearnings and sense of survival have created one of the most beautiful symphonies based on water in these places.
