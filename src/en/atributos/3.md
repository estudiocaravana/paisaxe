_Socalcos, sucalcos, muras, paredes, muros, pared√≥s, calzadas,_ are all names given to the crop terraces, a characteristic and singular feature of the Ribeira Sacra and, above all, a highly efficient water and soil resource.

The _socalcos,_ the spectacular terracing of agricultural cultivation on extremely steep slopes, are an epic work of human colonisation.

This is a land that has specialised in viticulture since the Middle Ages, without forgetting the importance of other crops such as chestnuts and cherries. The unique nature, the monastic footprint and the peasant communities built this landscape, which is alive and functional to this day.
