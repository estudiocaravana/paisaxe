It is water that in many cases delimits the parishes, units of identity in rural areas. Rivers unite and separate. Numerous villages build their farmhouses on the _bocarribeira_, where the slopes begin and the _socalcos_, the terraces, descend into the abyss.

One of the most significant features is the extreme smallholding, which leaves its mark on the landscape. A parcel of land defined by traditional formulas of land ownership and use, such as the _"cavadura"_, a traditional measure of the surface and working area: the land that a person could work in a day for their livelihood.

They all survive in this epic landscape, brought together by the culture of water.
