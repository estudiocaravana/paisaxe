The exceptional, dense and diverse hydraulic heritage, which manifests itself in the extensive catalogue of energy solutions from the Middle Ages to the middle of the 20th century and constitutes a veritable catalogue of the history of hydroelectric power, exponents of the medieval technological revolution and the irruption of hydroelectricity.

Its highlights are the hundreds of remains of watermills that were deployed between the 11th and 19th centuries, the first mini-power stations that mark the emergence of hydroelectricity at the end of the 19th century, the hydroelectric dams that illustrate the achievements of engineering in the first half of the 20th century, and the immense repertoire of small works created throughout the cultural landscape.
