crit: Criteria
criterio: 'According to UNESCO criteria, it is presented under criterion (v)'
criterio_cuerpo: '<p>To be an outstanding example of a traditional human settlement, land-use, or sea-use which is representative of a culture (or cultures), or human interaction with the environment especially when it has become vulnerable under the impact of irreversible change.</p>'
valor: 'Outstanding Universal Value (OUV)'
valor_entrada: '<p>The nominated property shows an exceptional cultural waterscape embedded between the spectacular river canyons located at the confluence of the rivers Sil and Miño (Galicia, Spain), on the Atlantic coast of rainy Iberia, popularly known as Ribeira Sacra.</p>'
valor_cuerpo: '<p>It is an epic landscape brought about by the culture and heritage of water, sustained by its countless streams, brooks and rivers that define its unique identity, beauty, composition and settlement patterns. It illustrates the origin and evolution of a territory sculpted by water and a paradigm of a water culture, in which the traces that have marked its construction over more than 1,500 years of continuous occupation can be vividly recognised, and that has its origins in the ancient hermit and monastic tradition rooted in this area.</p>

<p>The culture of water in these places is reflected in an exceptional water heritage that includes archaeological sites, the water-associated devices of all periods, including an important hydraulic industrial heritage, the unique drainage systems of the <i>socalcos</i> or crop terraces, as well as multiple other vernacular manifestations in the form of sacralised fountains and mines, canals, dams, passes and bridges, river routes and other unique works associated with water.</p>

<p>The power of water is a fundamental part of the cultural landscape narrative. The area of the
nominated property contains an exceptional catalogue of heritage elements of hydraulic use
that continuously bear witness to the energy self-sufficiency of each period, including
traditional water mills from different centuries, whose works survive in exceptional number
and density around the area of the property, followed by the mini-power stations or <i>fábricas</i>
de luz (factories producing electricity) that emerged at the end of the 19th century, until the
hydroelectric reservoirs of the mid-20th century arrived.</p>

<p>In short, Ribeira Sacra presents a cultural landscape in which one can read the story of the
wonderful relationship between water, humans and their ingenuity, not only to ensure their
survival and well-being, but also to make the most of all its possible uses.</p>'

**The following conclusions were reached:**

1. The paradigm shift in the concept of cultural heritage, goes from being exclusively linked to the material, to being understood today as a living, dynamic element in constant interaction with that which is human. New typologies are incorporated, reflecting the new elements to which society attributes value, and the boundary between what is natural, cultural and intangible is blurred. Cultural landscapes have the capacity to integrate and bring together all these elements.
2. The need to find appropriate, sustainable solutions to safeguard cultural landscapes in view of their specificities, based on knowledge that incorporates interdisciplinarity and transdisciplinarity. To understand the different strata that make up the landscape, to reflect on conservation goals and, especially, on the needs of local communities.
3. World Heritage candidacies and their necessary link with Academia and other research centres, due to the indispensable role of scientific knowledge in defining the basis of a nomination for registration on the World Heritage List.
4. The complexity of the process to achieve inclusion on the World Heritage List, both in defining and identifying the values, significance and character of the property as well as from the point of view of the requirements, which must comply with exceptionality, authenticity integrity and the existence of an appropriate management system and management plan. On the other hand, the achievements that the process itself generates, favouring the exchange of experiences, the development of joint strategies, new tools and strengthening of the sense of pride and belonging.
5. The growing importance of developing management plans in the management of World Heritage sites. Knowledge of the elements that structure the landscape, as well as the involvement of administrations and local communities, are key to promoting initiatives that allow present and future generations to continue to inhabit the territory, from a sustainable development perspective.
6. Local people must be at the centre of the design, implementation and monitoring of cultural heritage planning and management strategies. The knowledge and participation of those who live and coexist with the cultural landscape is indispensable in order to draw up efficient public policies.
7. The benefits of new technologies as a tool for research, documentation and conservation of cultural heritage; but also for the design of dissemination and communication strategies, adapted to the needs of different audiences. Likewise, the opportunity that social networks represent for raising awareness among the new generations, through the creation of quality content, aligned with sustainable development goals.
8. The benefits of networking and exchanging experiences with other cultural landscapes and World Heritage sites for the identification of shared needs, the development of joint projects and the design of dissemination, communication and promotion actions.
9. The importance of involving local tourist guides in the process, training them and providing them with all the knowledge available on cultural heritage, given their important role in the visitors&#39; understanding of the meaning of the place they visit, favouring an attitude of respect, care and appreciation.
10. The necessary management of visitor flows through the management of mobility, carrying capacity and reception capacity, in order to avoid the negative effects that tourism can have on the authenticity and conservation of cultural landscapes.
11. The administrative complexity of cultural landscape nominations, which is a challenge for the competent bodies at different scales (local, regional and national) and in different fields (culture, agriculture, tourism, mobility, environment, etc.)
12. The value of cultural landscapes as resources in the face of some future challenges, such as the fight against climate change, the depopulation of rural areas and sustainable development.
