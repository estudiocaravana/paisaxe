limite_cuerpo: '<p>Runs along the upper edges of the valleys of the rivers Sil and Miño in the sections close to the junction of the two rivers. Its boundary is defined on the ground in what is locally known as <b>bocarribeira</b>, which is the place where the slope changes abruptly, going from values above 30% (ribeiras) to values below 10% (chairas)'
crit: Criteria
criterio: 'According to UNESCO criteria, it is presented under criterion (v)'
criterio_cuerpo: '<p>To be a prominent example of traditional forms of human settlement or use of land or sea, representative of a culture (or several cultures), or of man&#39;s interaction with the environment, especially when the environment has become vulnerable due to the impact of irreversible changes.</p>'
valor: 'Outstanding Universal Value (OUV)'
valor_entrada: '<p>The nominated property shows an exceptional cultural waterscape embedded between the spectacular river canyons located at the confluence of the rivers Sil and Miño (Galicia, Spain), on the Atlantic coast of rainy Iberia, popularly known as Ribeira Sacra.</p>'
valor_cuerpo: '<p>It is an epic landscape brought about by the culture and heritage of water, sustained by its countless streams, brooks and rivers that define its unique identity, beauty, composition and settlement patterns. It illustrates the origin and evolution of a territory sculpted by water and a paradigm of a water culture, in which the traces that have marked its construction over more than 1,500 years of continuous occupation can be vividly recognised, and that has its origins in the ancient hermit and monastic tradition rooted in this area.</p>

<p>The culture of water in these places is reflected in an exceptional water heritage that includes archaeological sites, the water-associated devices of all periods, including an important hydraulic industrial heritage, the unique drainage systems of the socalcos or crop terraces, as well as multiple other vernacular manifestations in the form of sacralised fountains and mines, canals, dams, passes and bridges, river routes and other unique works associated with water.</p>

<p>The power of water is a fundamental part of the cultural landscape narrative. The area of the
nominated property contains an exceptional catalogue of heritage elements of hydraulic use
that continuously bear witness to the energy self-sufficiency of each period, including
traditional water mills from different centuries, whose works survive in exceptional number
and density around the area of the property, followed by the mini-power stations or fábricas
de luz (factories producing electricity) that emerged at the end of the 19th century, until the
hydroelectric reservoirs of the mid-20th century arrived.</p>

<p>In short, Ribeira Sacra presents a cultural landscape in which one can read the story of the
wonderful relationship between water, humans and their ingenuity, not only to ensure their
survival and well-being, but also to make the most of all its possible uses.</p>'

**The following conclusions were reached:**

1. The paradigm shift in the concept of cultural heritage, goes from being exclusively linked to
   the material, to being understood today as a living, dynamic element in constant interaction
   with that which is human. New typologies are incorporated, reflecting the new elements to
   which society attributes value, and the boundary between what is natural, cultural and
   intangible is blurred. Cultural landscapes have the capacity to integrate and bring together all
   these elements.
2. The need to find appropriate, sustainable solutions to safeguard cultural landscapes in view
   of their specificities, based on knowledge that incorporates interdisciplinarity and
   transdisciplinarity. To understand the different strata that make up the landscape, to reflect on
   conservation goals and, especially, on the needs of local communities.
3. World Heritage candidacies and their necessary link with Academia and other research
   centres, due to the indispensable role of scientific knowledge in defining the basis of a
   nomination for registration on the World Heritage List.
4. The complexity of the process to achieve inclusion on the World Heritage List, both in
   defining and identifying the values, significance and character of the property as well as from
   the point of view of the requirements, which must comply with exceptionality, authenticity,
   integrity and the existence of an appropriate management system and management plan. On
   the other hand, the achievements that the process itself generates, favouring the exchange of
   experiences, the development of joint strategies, new tools and strengthening of the sense of
   pride and belonging.
5. The growing importance of developing management plans in the management of World
   Heritage sites. Knowledge of the elements that structure the landscape, as well as the
   involvement of administrations and local communities, are key to promoting initiatives that
   allow present and future generations to continue to inhabit the territory, from a sustainable
   development perspective.
6. Local people must be at the centre of the design, implementation and monitoring of cultural
   heritage planning and management strategies. The knowledge and participation of those who
   live and coexist with the cultural landscape is indispensable in order to draw up efficient public
   policies.
7. The benefits of new technologies as a tool for research, documentation and conservation of
   cultural heritage; but also for the design of dissemination and communication strategies,
   adapted to the needs of different audiences. Likewise, the opportunity that social networks
   represent for raising awareness among the new generations, through the creation of quality
   content, aligned with sustainable development goals.
8. The benefits of networking and exchanging experiences with other cultural landscapes and
   World Heritage sites for the identification of shared needs, the development of joint projects
   and the design of dissemination, communication and promotion actions.
9. The importance of involving local tourist guides in the process, training them and providing
   them with all the knowledge available on cultural heritage, given their important role in the
   visitors&#39; understanding of the meaning of the place they visit, favouring an attitude of respect,
   care and appreciation.
10. The necessary management of visitor flows through the management of mobility, carrying
    capacity and reception capacity, in order to avoid the negative effects that tourism can have
    on the authenticity and conservation of cultural landscapes.
11. The administrative complexity of cultural landscape nominations, which is a challenge for
    the competent bodies at different scales (local, regional and national) and in different fields
    (culture, agriculture, tourism, mobility, environment, etc.)
12. The value of cultural landscapes as resources in the face of some future challenges, such as
    the fight against climate change, the depopulation of rural areas and sustainable development.
